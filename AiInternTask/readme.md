# AI Document Chatbot & Theme Identifier

**Project developed for the Wasserstoff Gen-AI Internship Task.**

This application leverages Generative AI to provide an interactive platform for document analysis. Users can upload multiple documents, receive answers to queries based on their content with precise citations, and automatically extract common themes present across the document set.

## üìú Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create an intelligent system capable of ingesting a large corpus of documents (minimum 75, supporting formats like PDF, scanned images, and TXT). The system allows users to perform research by asking natural language questions and to identify overarching themes synthesized from the processed documents. This project emphasizes both research-driven development and practical implementation of Generative AI applications.

## üöÄ How to Use the Deployed Application

1.  **Upload Documents:** Navigate to the "Upload & Process Documents" section. Select your files (PDFs, images, TXT) using the file uploader.
2.  **Process Files:** After selecting files, click the "Process Uploaded Files" button. This will save the files and extract their text content.
3.  **Initialize Knowledge Base:** Once files are processed, go to the sidebar and click the "Initialize/Re-Initialize Knowledge Base" button. This step prepares the documents for querying and theme extraction and may take some time as models are loaded and the database is built.
4.  **Ask Questions:** After the Knowledge Base is successfully initialized (indicated in the sidebar), go to the "Ask Questions" section. Type your question and click "Ask Question" to receive an answer and cited sources.
5.  **Extract Themes:** Similarly, after Knowledge Base initialization, go to the "Extract Themes" section and click "Extract Common Themes" to view a table of identified themes and their supporting documents.
